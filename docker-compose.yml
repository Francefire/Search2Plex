    # Note: Vite env vars are build-time, so we need to pass them as build args or 
    # ensure they are available during the build process if using multi-stage builds.
    # However, for runtime config in Nginx/React, we usually bake them in.
    # For this simple setup, we assume the user will provide .env at build time.
